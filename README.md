They have selected Azure Stack as the deployment method along with the Azure public cloud.

# Target Audience
- Infrastructure Engineer
- System Administrator
- Cloud Engineer


# Abstract 

## Workshop


This workshop is designed to teach attendees how to design a hybrid cloud architecture using a combination of the Azure public cloud and Azure Stack. This functional architecture will enable customers to leverage their investments in Azure as a "cloud platform," rather than Azure as a "place." Attendees will learn to determine which systems are good candidates for the Azure public cloud and which are better suited on Azure Stack.

After completing workshop, attendees will be better able to recommend and design hybrid cloud systems that leverage one application and deployment model: Azure.

In addition, attendees will learn to:

-   Understand when the Azure public cloud versus Azure Stack is appropriate based on customer requirements.

-   Describe possible integrations between Azure public cloud solutions and Azure Stack

-   Understand the taxonomy of Azure Stack: tenants, regions, subscriptions, offers, plans, services and quotas.

-   Describe the resource providers that are available for use with Azure Stack.

-   Design and deploy hybrid connectivity between Azure public cloud and Azure Stack.

## Whiteboard Design Session

This workshop is designed to teach attendees how to design a hybrid cloud architecture using a combination of the Azure public cloud and Azure Stack. This functional architecture will enable customers to leverage their investments in Azure as a "cloud platform," rather than Azure as a "place." Attendees will learn to determine which systems are good candidates for the Azure public cloud and which are better suited on Azure Stack.

## Hand-on Lab
In this hands-on lab, you will deploy the Azure Stack Development Kit and deploy the SQL Database and Azure App Service resource providers as well as download several virtual machine images from the Azure Stack Marketplace. From there, you will implement a full taxonomy in Azure Stack consisting of a region, subscription, plan, offer, and quotas. After Azure Stack is configured, you will then deploy Azure SQL Database, Web and API apps and then deploy the Contoso application.
